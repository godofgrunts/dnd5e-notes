Dragonlands

## Recap

### Simplified back stories

#### William Beverly

William Beverly, having narrowly escaped capture after his latest heist, has stowed away on a Dwarven merchant ship headed for the Dragonlands, an island nation east of NATION_NAME. He has heard rumors of a valuable artifact that will bring this human rouge riches unknown.

#### Zoex

Zoex, a tiefling, has been under tiefling racism for all his life. Finding little hope in station in life, he has set off to the dragonlands to find his place.

#### Calypso

Calypso the cat. NEED TO ADD BACKSTORY. CHANGED

#### Sauriv

Kosj was the last born amongst his hatching group and one of the shortest. These factors combined earned him the name Kosj (meaning "small" in Draconic). This wasn't an insult, it was just how he was called. At the age of 6 Kosj took his place with the other young Kobolds in the mines. Moving rocks from the latest expansion to the crushing fields. Life was good. 

At age 6 Kosj was moved to the crushing fields. This meant that Kosj would be assigned a crushing hammer. Kobolds don't really care about vanity, but it is a matter of pride to take care of your tools and Kosj did just that. Life was good.

Until it wasn't. A sudden tremor disturbed the caves one night while Kosj was on his shift. A roar ripped through the twists and turns. The god had appeared. According to the elders, it had been over a decade since the last time the god had appeared. Whispers started spreading through the tribe. Who was going to see what our god wanted? What if he was angry? Better to send out one of the younger kids on the chance he's just looking for a snack right? Need of the many outweighs the few after all.

Kosj walked outside to meet his literal god. As much as a reptilian brain can experience awe, Kosj experienced it as he looked upon this massive green dragon.

“You.” the Achuak Yaersunar, the Gruesome Tyrant spoke. “I need you to find Irthiski Jhank (meaning Little Secret Hammer), my cleric. Do not stray from my path and I shall grant you the power to fulfill my bidding.”

Kosj just stood still. Unable to say anything in the presence of his god.

“Do not move.”

Achuak Yaersunar removed two scales. A tiny one from his tail, about the size of Kosj’s own scales, and another from his side about a foot in diameter.

“This will hurt.”

Achuak Yaersunar spits a small bit of acid on the tiny scale, grabs Kosj to hold him still, and presses the scale against the kobold’s chest.

Unimaginable pain. The air escapes Kosj’s lungs and he is unable to scream.

“You are now Sauriv Sunathaer”. (meaning Eye Cleric or the dragon’s eye) “Do not fail me.”

And with that, Sauriv passed out.

The daylight warms the kobold’s skin which stirs him awake. The sudden feeling of the weave flowing through Sauriv’s body causes him to panic slightly. Sauriv then, almost reflexively, breathes poison (posion spray, Draconic Sorcery). This… This was new.

Lying next to him was the bigger scale the dragon removed. Upon it glowed a silhouette of a green dragon’s head, glowing the color of its acid. Sauriv picked it up and instinctively understood it was to be his shield. It also seems that the dragon has left him chain mail to protect him. With a quest ahead of him and no idea where to start, Sauriv headed back into the mines.
