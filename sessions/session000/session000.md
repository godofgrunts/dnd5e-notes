Dragonlands

## Recap

Our story opens up on a [dwarven](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf) merchant ship sailing across NAME OF OCEAN. As the sun peaks over the horizon the stage is set. Three adventures, a human, a tiefling, and a cat, have found themselves heading towards the Dragonlands each for their reasons.

From the east a ship approaches. It is hovering slightly above the water and 6 dragon wings flap powerfully as the ship comes in at ramming speed.

"TILLER TO STARBOARD! READY THE CANNONS! BATTLE STATIONS!"

The calls came to late, however, as the dragon winged ship rammed into the vessel only moments later. The dwarves tried to mount a resistance, but it was crushed under the force of the SCALELESS. Almost as quickly as it started, it was over. Every person still alive was captured and loaded onto the ship. After a few hours of traveling, our heros find themselves naked, caged, and located underground in some kind of mine.

Kosj, now known as Sauriv, woke up wondering if the previous day had been a dream, but as he looked to his left and found the dragon scale shield he knew this was not the case. [Achuak Yaersunar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16770-adult-green-dragon) had tasked him with a holy mission and he knew he must go. Sauriv puts on his gear and heads for the exit to the mines.

Walking into the next room, Sauriv sees three cages that had not been there before. Curiously he approaches them.

"Hey, you got any keys on you?" the naked human whispers to the kobold. Sauriv had not known where these people had come from and simply replied, "Keys?".

"Yeah you got to get us out of here." the human stated as if it should have been obvious.

"Oh! Did Achuak Yaersunar send you to help me?" questioned Sauriv. For what other reason would there be these weird people this deep in the mines?

"Uh... Yeah. He totally sent us to help you, now get us out!"

That was all Sauriv needed to hear, he took his ball peen hammer and started to smash the lock of the tiefling (the closest cage to him) while the human used worked on the other locks. The noise attracted attention from a nearby room and a kobold rounds the corner.

"Run! Follow me!" Sauriv yells as he dashes towards the exit.

William Beverly, the human, sprints ahead of Sauriv and makes it to the exit of the room first, but he hears voices and immediately leaps in the air and performs a ceiling cling. Calpyso uses Disguise Self to appear as a Sauriv and rushes forward, hoping to avoid attention. Sauriv follows behind and is very confused to see himself in front of him. Calpyso turns and finger guns at Sauriv saying "You got this buddy!" using [Bardic Inspiration.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/bard#BardicInspiration) Zoex, the tiefling turns to fight the kobolds invading from the rear using [fire bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt).

![Don't look too closely at this image :)](https://github.com/godofgrunts/dnd5e-notes/blob/master/sessions/session000/hide-and-disguise.jpg)

In the next room, a black [dragonborn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/16-dragonborn) and two more kobolds look at the two kobolds in surprise. "That way!" Calypso yells, point back towards the other room and the three head that way. William Beverly, seeing an opportunity, darts forward to round a pillar, but he runs right into Predicator Lause who proceeds to one shot William Beverly with [Scorching Ray.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scorching-ray)

In the previous room, Zoex has already blasted one kobold with a firebolt and comes face to face with the three new combatants and cast burning hands catching the kobold and dragonborn in the blast.

Sauriv runs up the Predicator Lause and exclaims "Wait! Achuak Yaersunar has told me to bring these three with on a quest! Look! He has blessed me with his breath!" and with the Bardic Inspiration breaths a very convincing Poison Spray. Annoyed, but convinced, Predicator Lause, hands Sauriv a healing potion, turns, and leaves.

Seeing this, the dragonborn commands everyone to stop and sends the remaining Kobolds away. Sauriv turns to leave and and the dragonborn commands him to stay.

"I am Dahl. If you want to get out of here get in the crates and don't make a sound."

Conveniently, these crates contained the gear of the caged members. They all get in a crate and are carried off.

### Simplified back stories

#### William Beverly

[William Beverly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1-human), having narrowly escaped capture after his latest heist, has stowed away on a Dwarven merchant ship headed for the Dragonlands, an island nation east of NATION_NAME. He has heard rumors of a valuable artifact that will bring this human rouge riches unknown.

#### Zoex

[Zoex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/7-tiefling), a tiefling, has been under tiefling racism for all his life. Finding little hope in station in life, he has set off to the dragonlands to find his place.

#### Calypso

[Calypso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat) the cat. NEED TO ADD BACKSTORY. CHANGED

#### Sauriv

[Kosj](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026395-kobold) was the last born amongst his hatching group and one of the shortest. These factors combined earned him the name Kosj (meaning "small" in Draconic). This wasn't an insult, it was just how he was called. At the age of 6 Kosj took his place with the other young Kobolds in the mines. Moving rocks from the latest expansion to the crushing fields. Life was good. 

At age 6 Kosj was moved to the crushing fields. This meant that Kosj would be assigned a crushing hammer. Kobolds don't really care about vanity, but it is a matter of pride to take care of your tools and Kosj did just that. Life was good.

Until it wasn't. A sudden tremor disturbed the caves one night while Kosj was on his shift. A roar ripped through the twists and turns. The god had appeared. According to the elders, it had been over a decade since the last time the god had appeared. Whispers started spreading through the tribe. Who was going to see what our god wanted? What if he was angry? Better to send out one of the younger kids on the chance he's just looking for a snack right? Need of the many outweighs the few after all.

Kosj walked outside to meet his literal god. As much as a reptilian brain can experience awe, Kosj experienced it as he looked upon this massive green dragon.

“You.” the Achuak Yaersunar, the Gruesome Tyrant spoke. “I need you to find Irthiski Jhank (meaning Little Secret Hammer), my cleric. Do not stray from my path and I shall grant you the power to fulfill my bidding.”

Kosj just stood still. Unable to say anything in the presence of his god.

“Do not move.”

Achuak Yaersunar removed two scales. A tiny one from his tail, about the size of Kosj’s own scales, and another from his side about a foot in diameter.

“This will hurt.”

Achuak Yaersunar spits a small bit of acid on the tiny scale, grabs Kosj to hold him still, and presses the scale against the kobold’s chest.

Unimaginable pain. The air escapes Kosj’s lungs and he is unable to scream.

“You are now Sauriv Sunathaer”. (meaning Eye Cleric or the dragon’s eye) “Do not fail me.”

And with that, Sauriv passed out.

The daylight warms the kobold’s skin which stirs him awake. The sudden feeling of the weave flowing through Sauriv’s body causes him to panic slightly. Sauriv then, almost reflexively, breathes poison (posion spray, Draconic Sorcery). This… This was new.

Lying next to him was the bigger scale the dragon removed. Upon it glowed a silhouette of a green dragon’s head, glowing the color of its acid. Sauriv picked it up and instinctively understood it was to be his shield. It also seems that the dragon has left him chain mail to protect him. With a quest ahead of him and no idea where to start, Sauriv headed back into the mines.
