# Session 2

## Recap

The party enters into an open cavern and see 3 ogres talking. The party has noticed the cave structure is dubious at best and makes a plan to knock some stalactites  down on to the enemies before engaging.

Zoex cast firebolt that fails to knock down a stalactite. William Beverly shoots a bolt at another, but during the flight Suzanna cast Shatter hitting the same stalactite and dropping on the first ogre (Ogre #1).

Ogre #1 charges at the party and fails jumping over a creek and falls into it.

Ogre #2 runs over his ally and engages Dahl.

Ogre #3 is caught off guard.

During the battle William Beverly repositions in front of a spider web and manages to stop off it's embrace. Dahl manages to kill Ogre #2. Ogre #1 falls the next turn to Suzaana. Ogre #3 turns to run and Dahl taunts him back into a fight.

Sauriv, not wanting the ogre to be able to run away, uses Command: Sit!

In an act of pure recklessness, under the effects of Heroism, William Beverly loads Calypso into his crossbow and shoots her into a stalactite hanging over the goaded Ogre #3. Calypso smacks into stalactite which causes it to fall. Ogre #3 manages to move at the last second and only takes half damage.

Ogre #3 suddenly sits down, seemingly accepting his death sentence, and Dahl lops off his head.
