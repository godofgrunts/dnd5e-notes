We explore the cave a little bit and find a room with a chest in it.

After arguing how best to approach this crate, the cat and I jump in and fall down a spike pit. Narrowly avoiding a spike through the gut we land and take damage. We find a dwarf (Lionel) who the other party members recoginze as a member of the boat they rode on. Calypso uses [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds).

I see a glint in the dirt and dig it up. It ends up being +1 Plate Armor of the First Fear.

William Beverly immediately knows it's evil and trys to tell me to take it off. I, however, feel fine and don't want to.

William Beverly tells me to drop to my knees and close my eyes. After doing so he asks me to call Achuak and ask him. He tries to pretend to be Achuak but speaks in common to me and I immediately know that isn't correct. This is the first time I knew someone was deceiving me...

Dhal and William Beverly go off and talk about something on the side and the party decides to enter the ruins.

We enter a room that is flanked by 6 suits of armor made of stone. In front of us is a gelatinious cube.
