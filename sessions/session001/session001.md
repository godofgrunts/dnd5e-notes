# Session 1

## Recap
After being smuggled into a secret room in the mines where we meet Suzanna. She is going to help us escape. She will take all but the Kobold through the kitchens while Dahl and Sauriv will exit under the guise of being trained.

After casting a spell to makes the three appear to be in shackles, they end up in the slave kitchen when an unexpected inspection happens by a ward. Calypso fails to bluff her way out of the inspection and Drake starts a grease fire as a distraction. Zoex assist with the distraction by casting Fire Bolts in other parts of the kitchen.

Cleverly, Calypso uses Disguise Self to transform into a kobold and blends into the commotion. The ward, believing that Calypso has escaped, chases after her back into the mines. The group escapes out of a back entrance to the kitchen.

Sauriv and Dahl make it past two checkpoints, but Sauriv's outbursts of "I'm training!" was less conspicious than Dahl would have liked. After getting past the second checkpoint Auchuak contacted Sauriv. Auchuak wanted to know why it was taking so long to get to the next city. Sauriv explained that it was taking a little longer because he needed to get the friends that Auchuak sent out of the mines safely. Auchuak tells Sauriv to keep his friends close to him and to make haste to the next city.

Sauriv spoke his of the conversation out loud to which Dahl could hear. Dahl angerly asked Sauriv if he really served the Gruesome Tyrant to which Sauriv naively explained to him "Of course! Achuak is my god after all!" Dahl seems upset, but doesn't believe that Sauriv understand the implications of his servitude.

The party meets back up in another secret room where they are allowed to rest. Suzanna gives the party two options, try to get out through the main entrace of the mines (security has increased recently) or try to go through the recently discovered ruins.

While discussing the options Sauriv asks which way is faster. Suzanna informs the party that main entrance would be faster to get out of the mine, but the ruin's exit is closer to the next city. Sauriv demands that the party goes through the ruins then as Achuak demands speed. The party rest for the night and heads out the next morning.

The party, with Dahl and Suzanna, head towards the entrance of the ruins where they unexpectedly run into a patrol returing from the ruins.

A battle ensues! Sauriv, not wanting to hurt his kin, grapples one of the attacking dragonborn and cast Sanctuary on Calypso trying to calm the situation. A bolt pierces the dragonborn's skull and Calypso gets her head bashed in by one of the attacking kobolds. This causes Sauriv to go berserk casting Word of Radiance by roaring and nearly hitting Dahl. In a rage that no one has seen of Sauriv, his weapon glows white hot and he smash the skull of the nearby dragonborn and kobold attacking Calypso.

While the rest of the group celebrates their victory, Sauriv quietly sits by himself and carves a small, iron effigy of a kobold in memeory the his slain kin.
